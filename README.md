# GraphQL Pets 

GraphQL Pets is built to accompany this [Intro to GraphQL Lesson](http://backend.turing.io/module4/lessons/intro-to-graphql). The `master` branch has a starter boilerplate in Express/GraphQL and is hitting a JSON DB to avoid having to worry about database setup. The `completed` branch shows working versions of queries and mutations. 

To get running on your machine, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ameseee/graphql-pets.git
npm install 
```

To run the JSON sever, run:
```bash
npm run json:server
```
and visit `http://localhost:3000/pets` or `http://localhost:3000/companies` to see the JSON.



To run the GraphQL server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
and visit `http://localhost:4000/graphql` to use the GraphiQL application.
